## 🚀 Projects

### [Español con Amor](https://espanolconamor.com/)
I developed a comprehensive website and booking form tailored for a Spanish teacher. The project involved customizing the functionality of cal.com through the use of webhooks and Firebase functions.

#### Key Features:
- **Custom Booking Form:** Implemented a user-friendly booking form with specific fields relevant to language classes.
- **Integration with cal.com:** Leveraged webhooks to seamlessly integrate the booking system with cal.com, ensuring real-time updates and synchronization.
